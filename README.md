Use of wireless communication protocol
LoRa for IoT system needs these days
growing. The IoT system itself is increasingly
extends to various fields and needs. However
that way the IoT system needs a protocol
communication with a wide range but also must
Can be used by many devices at the same time.
This study will examine the effect of spreading factor
on the LoRa wireless communication protocol against
packet collisions found.

End on research
This will convey suggestions for using the protocol
LoRa wireless communication with configuration
a spreading factor that suits the needs of each
IoT system. Where if the higher the spreading
the factor, the wider the reach
the network but the more packets
the collision. Conversely, if the lower the spreading
the factor will be the narrower the network coverage
but the less packet collisionnya. Study
It uses MatLab software as a simulation tool
LoRa wireless communication protocol.
